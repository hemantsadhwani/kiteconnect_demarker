# Entry2 Hyperparameters Grid Search Configuration
# Optimizes Entry2 indicator parameters in indicators_config.yaml
# Target: DYNAMIC_ATM (all trades, no market sentiment filter)

# Grid Search Parameters
GRID_SEARCH:

    MAX: 29
    STEP: 10
  
  # WPR Slow Length range
  WPR_SLOW_LENGTH:
    MIN: 28
    MAX: 68
    STEP: 10

# Optimization Target
OPTIMIZATION:
  # Primary metric to optimize for
  PRIMARY_METRIC: "composite"  # Options: filtered_pnl, win_rate, composite
  
  # Composite scoring weights (if PRIMARY_METRIC is "composite")
  # Goal: Reduce trades, increase win rate, with marginal P&L reduction
  COMPOSITE_WEIGHTS:
    FILTERED_PNL: 0.3      # Lower weight on P&L (marginal reduction acceptable)
    WIN_RATE: 0.5          # Higher weight on win rate
    TRADE_REDUCTION: 0.2   # Weight on reducing number of trades
  
  # Strike type to optimize for (DYNAMIC_ATM only - no market sentiment filter)
  STRIKE_TYPE: "DYNAMIC_ATM"  # Only DYNAMIC_ATM is optimized

# Execution Settings
EXECUTION:
  # Timeout for workflow execution (seconds)
  # Full workflow can take 30-60 minutes depending on data size
  WORKFLOW_TIMEOUT: 3600  # 1 hour default
  
  # Restore indicators_config.yaml after completion
  RESTORE_CONFIG: true
  
  # Clean up backup files after successful completion
  CLEANUP_BACKUPS: true  # Set to false to keep backup files

# Logging
LOGGING:
  LEVEL: "INFO"  # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
  SHOW_PROGRESS: true
  LOG_FILE: "grid_search.log"  # Log file name (saved in results directory)
